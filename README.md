# Investment Recommendation System Using ESG and Investor Behavior

## Overview
Welcome to our Investment Recommendation System! This project was built to bridge the gap between traditional financial analysis and modern sustainable investing. 


Standard stock recommendation tools often focus solely on price trends and financial ratios. While these are important, they miss two critical factors that drive today's market:
1. **ESG Performance**: A company's Environmental, Social, and Governance impact, which is a strong indicator of long-term sustainability and risk.
2. **Investor Behavior**: The "human" side of the market—sentiment and behavioral signals that influence short-term price movements.

Our system combines these elements to provide comprehensive, clearer, and more responsible investment recommendations.

## Team (Group 1)
This project is brought to you by:
- **Priyanshu Jain** (2024BTech179)
- **Aman Pratap Singh** (2024BTech136)
- **Harshit Mundra** (2024BTech186)

## The Problem
Investors today lack tools that look at the big picture. 
- **Traditional Methods**: Look at history (Price, P/E Ratio).
- **The Missing Piece**: Sustainability (ESG) and Market Sentiment.

Ignoring ESG exposes investors to long-term risks (like regulatory fines or climate change impact). Ignoring investor behavior means missing out on short-term market pulses. We solve this by integrating both.

## How It Works
The system processes data from two main models (as conceptualized):

1.  **Model 1 (Financial & ESG)**: 
    - Uses S&P 500 data.
    - Analyzes **Historical Stock Prices** for volatility and returns.
    - Integrates **ESG Scores** (Environment, Social, Governance) to assess risk.
    - considers **Market Capitalization** to cater to investor size preferences.

2.  **Model 2 (Investor Behavior)** (Conceptual/Planned):
    - Analyzes social sentiment (e.g., Reddit, News) to gauge market mood.

### Key Features
- **Smart Rankings**: We don't just show you stocks; we rank them based on a composite score of Profit vs. Risk vs. ESG Responsibility.
- **Customizable Profiles**: Whether you are a "Balanced" investor, an "ESG-Focused" green investor, or looking for "High Growth", the system adapts its recommendations to you.
- **Visual Insights**: Includes visualization tools to verify the correlation between ESG risk and financial returns.
